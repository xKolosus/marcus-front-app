# Marcus e-commerce

This is the main page for Marcus new e-commerce page!
- This connects to our main service and allows us to generate purchases!

Main components:
- Landing page with a carrousel each loading the available categories (on click loads the category and its products)
- Three card info with some extra info to allow the user to get more context of the application
- From the category product visualization, navigation is available and pagination, through product and its details.
- With a logged user, profile appears, and this loads the purchases a user has done, and the detail clicking on each shows the products that were bought.

Both visibilites will be implemented, for the admin, allowing him to:
- Manage user
- Manage products (creating, updating, reducing stock, etc...)
- Manage categories
- Manage purchases

And both authenticated user and not authenticated ones will be available to see the products and etc.
But only the ones logged would be possible to generate a purchase!

# Technologies used
- React 19
- Vite
- Redux
- Jwt
- Native css and html (components brought from online examples)

Thanks in advance!
Cosmin Constantin Chirila.
